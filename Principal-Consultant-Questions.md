# Liatrio Principal Consultant Questions

1. Can you travel up to 2 weeks out of 4 for consulting engagements to either
   coast? Are there any constraints we need to know about upfront that will
   prevent this regularly. (Mon-Thursday on site home every weekend)

    Yes and no :)

2. If everything goes well, how much lead time do you need to join Liatrio and
   when is the earliest you can join. Also, post joining, do you have any PTO
   planned out already in the medium term future (6 months)

    I could be ready to join in a few weeks time. The only thing I've got
    scheduled right now is a trip to see family at the end of August thru Sept.
    5 and Jenkins World / DevOps World on 9/18 & 9/19.

3. How much time commitment can you provide for the interview process from the
   first call to final in-person interview.

    I'm available for an hour for each of the first few calls or video chats.
    If you expect they'll go longer than that, I'm willing to work with you. If
    you decide to go forward, and want to do some kind of day onsite, that
    shouldn't be a problem either. I think we'd both be pretty sure it's a good
    match. 

4. Tell us how you have been involved in end to end software delivery that
   includes CI/CD, test automation, IaaC, and Cloud

5. Quickly define your familiarity with the following tools including when was
   the last time you were actually hands on with any of them:

    * Jenkins, Maven, Gulp or Grunt, Selenium, Cucumber, Chef or Puppet or
Ansible, Vagrant or Virtualbox, Nexus or Artifactory, AWS or Google or Azure

    * Jenkins: most recently used it to set up automated deployments in my
      current role; last used a few weeks ago

    * Maven: not much experience with it; I've built and packaged batch jobs at
      Capital One (ShareBuilder) to do end-of-day brokerage processing; last
      used close to two years ago

    * Gulp: no experience; Grunt: I've built and deployed node code at work
      for a partner application ("dealer portal"); last used a few months ago

    * Selenium: no experience

    * Chef: used a lot of Capital One for deployments which never seemed like a
      good fit; I mostly remember fighting with the central server; last used
      close to two years ago; Puppet: never for pay; Ansible: I've written a
      bunch of playbooks to spin up our environments as needed, and sometimes
      also use it for inventory queries; coached some of our developers on it,
      which worked out well; last used a few weeks ago

    * Vagrant or VirtualBox: I've used both sometime this year; VirtualBox is
      currently running on my work laptop as a host environment for minikube
      (kubernetes)
    * Nexus or Artifactory: my team maintained an Artifactory instance for
      local deployments. We also used a shared (corporate) Nexus instance; last
      used close to two years ago for both (at Capital One)
    * AWS: very familiar with a dozen or so services; use it every day; Google
      Cloud Platform or Azure: never for pay

6. Please define what you believe to be DevOps and what a DevOps transformation
   at a customer would look like.

    I think of "traditional" DevOps as 

7. Now that you have defined a DevOps transformation, how would you execute
   this at a customer?

8. Have you led a DevOps transformation and if so:

    * Please provide a specific company name/scenario AND a key accomplishment
      during that project?
    * Why do you think this accomplishment was significant for your client? How
      about your company?
